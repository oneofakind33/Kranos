This project aims to improve rider safety by using sensors and smart algorithms to detect accidents in real time. The helmet is equipped with an accelerometer, gyroscope, and GPS to monitor impact force, sudden deceleration, orientation, and location. If a collision or fall is detected, the system analyzes the data and immediately triggers alerts through audible alarms, visual indicators, and wireless notifications to smartphones or smartwatches. It can also automatically contact emergency services with the riderâ€™s location details. By combining advanced sensors, intelligent analysis, and real-time communication, this helmet provides proactive accident detection and rapid emergency response, ensuring greater safety and peace of mind for riders and their families.
